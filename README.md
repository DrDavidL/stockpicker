# stockpicker

Of course, this is NOT stock advice and merely applies 3 known technical indicators easily for you! And, you get to adjust your RSI thresholds.

After installing dependencies (just a few including ta for technical analysis and streamlit, and of course, yfinance, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib)...

Then run the app:

*streamlit run stockpicker.py* 

Or, check out my streamlit.io website:
